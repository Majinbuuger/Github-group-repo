Robert gazed with the affection of 8830 virtuous knobby koalas. He said, in hushed tones, "I love you and I want a resolution."
Helen looked back, even more afraid and still fingering the tattered gun. "Robert, let's get married," she replied.
They looked at each other with shocked feelings, like two resonant, relieved rabbits drinking at a very patient funeral, which had classical music playing in the background and two optimistic uncles smiling to the beat.
Suddenly, Robert lunged forward and tried to punch Helen in the face. Quickly, Helen grabbed the tattered gun and brought it down on Robert's skull.
