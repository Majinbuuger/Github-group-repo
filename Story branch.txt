Helen Platt was thinking about Robert Superhalk again. Robert was a spiteful juggler with pointy arms and handsome eyebrows.
Helen walked over to the window and reflected on her beautiful surroundings. She had always loved derelict West Boggins with its distinct, damaged ditches. It was a place that encouraged her tendency to feel concerned.
Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the a spiteful figure of Robert Superhalk.
Helen gulped. She glanced at her own reflection. She was a charming, daring, wine drinker with slimy arms and sloppy eyebrows. Her friends

But not even a charming person who had once helped a happy blind person recover from a flying accident, was prepared for what Robert had in store today.
The wind blew like swimming ostriches, making Helen afraid. Helen grabbed a tattered gun that had been strewn nearby; she massaged it with her fingers.

As Helen stepped outside and Robert came closer, she could see the petite smile on his face.
Robert gazed with the affection of 8830 virtuous knobby koalas. He said, in hushed tones, "I love you and I want a resolution."
Helen looked back, even more afraid and still fingering the tattered gun. "Robert, let's get married," she replied.
They looked at each other with shocked feelings, like two resonant, relieved rabbits drinking at a very patient funeral, which had classical music playing in the background and two optimistic uncles smiling to the beat.
Suddenly, Robert lunged forward and tried to punch Helen in the face. Quickly, Helen grabbed the tattered gun and brought it down on Robert's skull.

Robert's pointy arms trembled and his handsome eyebrows wobbled. He looked active, his emotions raw like a grim, gigantic gun.
Then he let out an agonising groan and collapsed onto the ground. Moments later Robert Superhalk was dead.
Helen Platt went back inside and made herself a nice glass of wine.
